# Team Profile Generator

This application was created to generate a team profile based on user input using the Inquirer module from Node.js and displaying the information on a newly created html page with a style sheet. This project helped me expand my knowledge of OOP and testing.

## Usage

* Use the inquirer command line to answer the questions that are prompted and then to the `dist` folder and open the `index.html` file.  <br>
